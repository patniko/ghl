- **Comprehensive Reports**: Generates detailed clinical reports covering 15 anatomical sections
- **Expert-Level Accuracy**: Performance comparable to experienced cardiologists
- **DICOM Processing**: Native support for medical DICOM file formats

### Primary Use Cases

#### 1. Clinical Cardiac Assessment
- **Automated Report Generation**: Generate comprehensive echocardiography reports from DICOM videos
- **Multi-View Analysis**: Combine apical, parasternal, and subcostal views for complete cardiac evaluation
- **Cardiac Function Assessment**: Evaluate left ventricular function, wall motion, and valve performance

#### 2. Research Applications
- **Large-Scale Studies**: Process thousands of echocardiograms for population health research
- **Standardized Analysis**: Ensure consistent interpretation across different operators and institutions
- **Longitudinal Tracking**: Monitor cardiac changes over time with standardized metrics

#### 3. Clinical Decision Support
- **Screening Programs**: Rapid assessment of cardiac function in screening scenarios
- **Quality Assurance**: Validate human interpretations with AI-powered second opinions
- **Training Support**: Educational tool for cardiology trainees

### Quick Start
```bash
cd models.echoprime/
make init
make download-weights
# Place DICOM files in raw_data/
make inference
```

## üìä EchoQuality: Video Quality Assessment

**Location**: `models.echoquality/`

### Purpose
EchoQuality is a specialized model that assesses the quality of echocardiogram videos before clinical analysis. It helps filter out low-quality studies that might lead to inaccurate diagnoses and ensures only suitable videos proceed to clinical interpretation.

### Key Capabilities
- **Automatic Quality Scoring**: Predicts whether video quality is acceptable for clinical use
- **Ultrasound Masking**: Automatically identifies and masks non-ultrasound regions
- **GradCAM Visualization**: Provides visual explanations of quality decisions
- **Debug Tools**: Comprehensive debugging suite for image scaling and processing issues

### Primary Use Cases

#### 1. Quality Control Pipeline
- **Pre-Processing Filter**: Screen echocardiograms before clinical analysis
- **Batch Processing**: Assess quality of large datasets automatically
- **Study Validation**: Ensure minimum quality standards for research studies

#### 2. Clinical Workflow Optimization
- **Acquisition Feedback**: Real-time quality assessment during echo acquisition
- **Repeat Study Decisions**: Determine when studies need to be repeated
- **Technician Training**: Provide objective feedback on image acquisition quality

#### 3. Research Data Curation
- **Dataset Cleaning**: Remove low-quality videos from research datasets
- **Quality Stratification**: Group studies by quality levels for analysis
- **Bias Reduction**: Ensure quality doesn't confound research results

### Quick Start
```bash
cd models.echoquality/
make inference  # Processes all DICOM files in raw_data/
```

- **Prognostic Prediction**: Predicts death events within 2-year follow-up (AUROC 93.4%)

### Primary Use Cases

#### 1. Cardiovascular Disease Detection
- **Multi-Disease Screening**: Simultaneous detection of 164 cardiovascular conditions
- **Arrhythmia Detection**: Identify various rhythm abnormalities from 12-lead ECGs
- **Structural Heart Disease**: Detect signs of cardiomyopathy, valve disease, and other structural abnormalities

#### 2. Risk Stratification
- **Mortality Prediction**: 2-year mortality risk assessment from ECG patterns
