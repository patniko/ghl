connect the entire pipeline by
1. add a process button for batches in the UI
2. have the service download all files in the batch for analysis
3. process files using the expected models
4. putting in place clear instructions for additional training based on new samples
5. showing batch processing progress and results
6. showing all up project stats

go the extra mile by
1. hooking in the training for the models.dino model so that as new batches come in it applies it to the model

finish everything by
1. packaging it for easy deployment on AWS
