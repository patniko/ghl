# FIGURES
This folder contains the images from the paper [[HuBERT-ECG: a self-supervised foundation model for broad and scalable cardiac applications](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.14.24317328v1)]  in `.svg` format and the resources, both data and code, to recreate them.
In particular, the code is organized in notebooks (`plot.ipynb` and `ecg_umap.ipynb`) to facilitate its use by the community.
The data to generate Figure 2 and Supplementary Figures is stored as `.xlsx` files, which are easily readable through standard libraries, and do not require any particular pre-processing. In this regard, following the notebook should be sufficient for recreation
The data to generate the subfigures of Figure 1 is based on the content of `./metadata/`, instead. This data is organized in `.json` files and contain useful information about the datasets used in our work.
