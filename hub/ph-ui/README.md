I've been creating dashboard UIs at work and for my personal projects. I always wanted to make a reusable collection of dashboard UI for future projects; and here it is now. While I've created a few custom components, some of the code is directly adapted from ShadcnUI examples.

> This is not a starter project (template) though. I'll probably make one in the future.

## Features

- Light/dark mode
- Responsive
- Accessible

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/satnaing/shadcn-admin.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd shadcn-admin
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pnpm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  pnpm run dev
```

## Running with API and Tasks

For a complete development environment, you can run the UI together with the API and task services using the combined commands from the ph-api directory:

```bash
# From the ph-api directory
make run-all            # Runs UI, API, and Tasks as separate processes
make run-all-integrated # Runs UI and API with integrated tasks
```

These commands will start all necessary services together, making it easier to develop and test the full application stack.
